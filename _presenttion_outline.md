## 🎥 Intro *(0:15–1:30)*

- Ecological models mostly rely on contemporary data  
- Yet ecosystems have evolved over thousands of years  
- Vegetation data are often fragmented, siloed, and temporally shallow  
- *Can we link past and present, traits and climate, into one coherent level?*

---

## 🧙 Player 1 *(1:30–2:30)*

- Assistant Professor at Charles University  
- Head of the Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology  
- Advocate of Open Science and reproducibility  
- Contact via website, GitHub, ORCID

## 🕹️ Level 0: The Quest *(2:30–4:00)*

- *Mission:* "Did vegetation in the Rocky Mountains maintain functional stability from the LGM to the present?"
- Requirements:
  - Fossil pollen and modern vegetation plots  
  - Functional traits (e.g. height, SLA, wood density)  
  - Climate data from past and present
- Obstacles:
  - Scattered formats, inconsistent taxonomies, climate rasters  
  - Multiple tools, steep learning curves, and limited reproducibility

---

## 🔓 Unlock the Shortcut *(4:00–5:00)*

- Imagine answering this question with just a few lines of code  
- Use `{vaultkeepr}` to:
  - Access vegetation, trait, and climate data simultaneously  
  - Filter by time range, spatial boundaries, and taxa  
  - Harmonise taxonomy and calculate community-weighted traits
- Minimal code, maximum reproducibility

---

## 🆙 Level Up with VegVault *(5:00–6:00)*

- A global SQLite database integrating plot-based paleo- and neo-vegetation data  
- Links to functional traits, soil properties, and climate variables  
- Built for millennial-scale ecological analyses  
- Fully open-source and reproducible infrastructure

---

## 🗃️ The Source Code *(6:00–6:30)*

- Data sources: Neotoma, BIEN, sPlotOpen, TRY, CHELSA, WoSIS  
- Taxonomic harmonisation via GBIF and `{taxospace}`  
- Abiotic data mapped to spatio-temporal grids  
- Modular, version-controlled pipelines with metadata

---

## 💎 Key Innovations *(6:30–7:00)*

- Temporal integration of paleo and contemporary data  
- Plot-based vegetation records (not just species occurrences)  
- Sample-specific climate and soil context  
- Standardised taxonomy and harmonised trait domains

---

## 🛠️ Controls *(7:00–7:30)*

- Access via `{vaultkeepr}` R package  
- SQL-free, tidyverse-compatible interface  
- Fully reproducible workflows via GitHub and Zenodo

---

## 💡 Side Quests *(7:30–8:30)*

- Additional use cases:
  - Explore biome transitions and trait shifts  
  - Test trait–environment relationships across time  
  - Quantify ecological novelty and functional turnover  
  - Reconstruct long-term diversity patterns  
  - Investigate trait-based community assembly

---

## 🏆 Summary *(8:30–9:00)*

- VegVault = open, robust, time-spanning vegetation research platform  
- Designed for reproducible, interdisciplinary ecological synthesis  
- *Join the quest – the tools are ready, and the map is open!*
